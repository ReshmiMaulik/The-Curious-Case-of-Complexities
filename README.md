# The-Curious-Case-of-Complexities
Python code for measuring the causal effect of McCabe’s complexity and Halstead’s effort on defects
For this problem, we follow the following steps:
1) Apply GES algorithm to discover the influences of the factors on defects.
2) Develop a causal model based on GES and build a Directed Acyclic Graph.
3) Apply causal inference techniques to validate causal model.
4) Make inferences based on the estimation of causal effects.
